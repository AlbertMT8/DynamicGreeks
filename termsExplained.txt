Call Option
    What it is: A contract that gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy an underlying stock at a specified price (the strike price) before a certain date.
    Why it matters: Call options let you profit from potential upside in a stock’s price with less capital outlay compared to buying the stock outright.


Put Option
    What it is: A contract that gives you the right (but not the obligation) to sell an underlying asset at the strike price before a certain date.
    Why it matters: Put options provide downside protection if you own the stock, or let you bet on a drop in the stock’s price without short-selling.


The 5 Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)
    What they are: Measures of an option’s price sensitivity to various factors:


    Delta: Change in the underlying stock’s price.


    Gamma: Rate of change of delta.


    Theta: Time decay of the option. It measures how much the option's value is expected to decrease each day as it gets closer to its expiration date.


    Vega: Sensitivity to changes in implied volatility. Higher vega means the option's price is more reactive to volatility changes.


    Rho: Sensitivity to interest rate changes.


    Why they matter: They help traders understand how an option’s value is likely to move in response to different market conditions, so they can manage risk more effectively.



Implied Volatility (IV)
    What it is: The market’s forecast of a stock’s potential price movement, derived from the option’s current market price.
    Why it matters: IV directly affects an option’s price—higher implied volatility generally increases option premiums (the price to buy an option), reflecting higher expected risk or uncertainty about the price.



Strike Price
    What it is: The price at which you can exercise the option (buy for calls or sell for puts).
    Why it matters: Determines the payoff if the option is exercised; choosing the right strike price is crucial to balancing cost and potential profit.



Black-Scholes Formula
    A mathematical model to calculate the price of an option.
